## 📖 Overview

The Social Network Platform was created to bring people together in a digital space where communities can thrive and ideas can be shared seamlessly. In an era of fast-growing online interactions, this project demonstrates how a modern social network can be scalable, secure, and developer-friendly, while delivering a smooth experience for end-users.

Built as a full-stack monorepo application, it combines a Next.js frontend, a NestJS backend, and shared UI components and utilities to showcase how real-world social networks are structured and maintained.

This project aims to serve as both a practical learning resource for developers and a starter framework for teams looking to build community-driven applications efficiently, following best practices in architecture, security, and CI/CD workflows.
